* Lead a group project to create a heartbeat sensor which uses video of the face and deep learning techniques. This was hosted on a server in a similar way to google deep dream.
* Created a back end service which authenticates users based on the way they type as part of a team web app project. Used PostgreSQL for managing the databases which stored users keystroke information.
* Worked in a team to create a compiler using ANTLR and java for a simple imperative language. Created an extension which used graph colouring to allocate registers.
* Completed PINTOS - a series of coursework aimed at improving the understanding of operating systems.
* Created an assembler and emulator for ARM architecture in a group project, then used the assembler to compile ARM assembly code into object code which activates lights on a raspberry pi when run.
* Completed weekly programming projects in Haskell, Java and C.
* Awarded a Computing Entrance Scholarship for outstanding A-level grades.
* Achieved a 1st honours for the second year of study including 91% in coursework and 92% in Compilers.
* Achieved a 1st honours for the third year of study.
