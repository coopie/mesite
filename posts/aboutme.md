Hello.

<img src="/resource/images/face-drawing1.jpg" width="inherit">

The name's Sam, and I'm from the shire , Worcestershire to be precise, about ten minutes away from Tolkien's house.

As many do, I moved to somewhere else to study. For me that place was West London, to study computing at Imperial College London. I now live in in London working as a deep learning researcher for [DigitalGenius](https://www.digitalgenius.com/).

## What I Like

### Media
Be they films, music, cartoons or video games, I love consuming and discussing media.

### Deep Learning
For the last few years, I have specialized in deep learning with a sub-specialization in language, be it programming languages or natural language. I am very interested in novel approaches to language generation, such as translation, summarization and also generative models.


### Programming
I don't think any other commercial or academic field has such a fast moving and beaureaucratic-less community as programmers do. Learning about new technologies, and the mathematics behind them, is one of my favorite pastimes.

I have a hobby of doing random things with functional programming languages, such as haskell and scala, and am of the belief that the future of programming lies in immutable data and functional programming.


### Escaping the City
When I am not doing any of these things, I also go rock climbing and try to do some hiking whenever I can.
